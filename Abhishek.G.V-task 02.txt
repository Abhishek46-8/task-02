1. Load the rest countries data using your html and script.js file 
and run a for loop on the data and print all the country name in the console. 
->CODE:
  var req= new XMLHttpRequest();
  req.open('GET','https://restcountries.eu/rest/v2/all',true);

  req.onload=function(){
  var data=JSON.parse(this.response);
  for(var i in data)
  console.log(data[i].name)
}

2. Give a write up on Difference between copy by value and copy by reference.
-> Copy by reference : Here the object is copied to another variable using = 
		      operator,or in other words the address of that value is copied
		      to another variable.Copy by reference can happen normally
		      to non-premitive data types like array,String.
                      eg:-var arr1=[1,2,3];
 			 var arr2=arr1;
  			 arr1[0]=10
  			 console.log(arr1);
  			 console.log(arr2);  
			Output:
				[ 10, 2, 3 ]
				[ 10, 2, 3 ]
   Copy by value: Here the value of one variable is copied to another variable using
		 = operator.This can performed on Primitive data types.
		eg :- var a=10;
		      var b=a;
		      a=3;
		      console.log(a,b);
		output:- 3 10
